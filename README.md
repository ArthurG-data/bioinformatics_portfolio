## ðŸ“– **Projects Overview**

### **Project 1: Sequencing Reads Alignment and Genome Annotation Analysis**
- **Goal**: Align sequencing reads to a reference genome and analyze the results using a genome annotation.
- **Tools**: Bowtie2, featureCounts (from the subread package).
- **Description**: This project focuses on analyzing sequencing reads after alignment and counting, providing insights into genomic regions of interest. Code is written in Python to process and visualize the results efficiently.

### **Project 3: CRISPR Guide RNA Specificity Evaluation**
- **Goal**: Evaluate the specificity of CRISPR guide RNA sequences to minimize the risk of off-target modifications.
- **Tools**: Python, Genome datasets (E. coli, S. aureus, S. bongori, S. pyogenes), CRISPR guide RNA sequences.
- **Description**: This project focuses on analyzing the specificity of guide RNA sequences for CRISPR gene editing. The analysis involves identifying potential off-target sites with up to 4 mismatches and calculating a risk score using the Zhang method. Python code is developed to automate the analysis and ensure reproducibility.

### **Project 4: Microbiome Analysis of Smokers and Non-Smokers**
- **Goal**: Investigate how smoking impacts the microbiomes of the nose and throat.
- **Tools**: Calour (Python library), BIOM table, metadata file, taxonomy file.
- **Description**: This project analyzes microbiome data to understand the differences in microbial communities between smokers and non-smokers. Using Calour, the analysis leverages a BIOM table for abundance counts, a metadata file for sample details, and a taxonomy file to link OTUs to their respective taxa. Additional Python code is implemented for customized data processing and result interpretation.

### **Project 5: Microbial Abundance Classification**
- **Goal**: Build simple classifiers to predict whether a person is a smoker based on microbiome data.
- **Tools**: Python (Jupyter/Colab), Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn), BIOM table, metadata file, taxonomy file.
- **Description**: This project extends the analysis of microbiome data by focusing on classification. Using the datasets from Project 4, classifiers are developed to predict smoking status based on microbial abundance patterns. The emphasis is on identifying suitable and simple machine learning methods, ensuring interpretability and appropriate application. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter or Colab notebook environment, with results submitted in HTML or PDF format.
